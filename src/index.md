## Interaction Designer and Frontend Web Developer

I specialise in semantic markup and responsive design, with a strong focus on accessibility and performance.

CSS and HTML are my tools. With them I bend the DOM and GUI to my will.

I code with people in mind first. I believe it’s any developer’s moral duty to create websites that are accessible to as many people as possible.

Technically that involves a whole heap of buzzwords. Responsive Web Design, Modular CSS, Semantic Markup, Progressive Enhancement, crossbrowser support and so on. All are important ingridients needed to serve an easily digestible web site.

I’m currently available for hiring.

## Interested?

The future is bright. Get in touch and we’ll make something great together.
